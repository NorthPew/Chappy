# Welcome to Chappy!
## Introduction
*Chappy* is a school project that was made with love and possible by **Norfe**.
This project is a fullstack application using *JavaScript*, some *HTML* and *CSS*.
Believe it!

It has charms of famous chat platforms such as *Discord* and *Guilded*, when it comes to design and layout. 
The creator of this project could have made a simpler GUI, but wanted to challange himself.
The project could have been made with only backend and do all requests using *Insomnia*, but it works both sides!
To spice things up, this project has authorization with the help of *JWT*.

With this project can you send messages to group channels and to other users who are in the database.
If the creator has time, it will also be possible to add new groups and new group channels. *Time will tell...*
### Frontend
It has been built upon *React*, *Vite*, *React router dom* and *Styled components*.
The frontend resembles much like Discord with it's look and feel.
*I hope Discord doesn't mind me using their design as inspiration.*

You can find all the frontend packages at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
### Backend
The backend side of the project is a *RESTful API* that uses *lowDB*, *CORS*, *JSON Web Tokens*, *Express* and some *Node*.
More of backend down the line.

You can find all the backend packages at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
